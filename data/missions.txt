			`	Static fills your screen for a moment before the blurry image of a man appears. He seems to be adjusting the camera and hitting some equipment outside your view. A clang is heard as his head comes into view, his eyes widen as he realises the call has gone through.`
			`	He slicks his hair back and puts on a smile. "Well ello there Captain <first> <last>, hope I didn't interrupt anything with this sudden call, but I have a proposition that only a Captain as capable as you, are applicable for!"`
			`	He wears a lopsided grin as he winks at you. "Now I understand you probably get dozens of smucks calling you up begging for cash, favours or whatever. So you probably have a healthy suspicion of random offers and such, but I want you to know I am not asking for any cash or signage, until I have shown you irrefutable proof that my offer is both the best you are likely to receive and undeniably profitable for yourself."`
			`	He darts to the side and quickly begins pulling from a stack of papers that seem to be haphazardly stacked behind him, before filling the camera with what looks to be a deed of some sort.`
			`	"I recently scrounged together enough capital, to buy up prime real-estate in the exclusive new world of-" He pulls the paper back and reads from it muttering. "Pugglemug, god what an idiotic name."`
			`	He looks back at you. "Uh yes, and as you undoubtedly know, it is in fact, the very same alien world that you my dear captain, played a major part in securing." He waits with an attempt at a charming smile as he seemingly waits for your reaction.`

				goto offer

			`	"And that work is what drew me to you, someone as accomplished and clearly skilled as yourself are the only one this lucrative offer could ever be offered to. No random smuck would work, only the best of the best, and that's you." He claps his hands together loudly. "Now onto the pitch."`
				goto offer
			label kissass
			`	He places his hands on his chest and puts on a pained face. "No no no, you are one of the most skilled and renowned captains this side of the Milkyway. Not just anyone could make a ship as powerful as the <ship>, nor save as many people as you undoubtedly did when beating back the vile Pug!" He finishes with a flourish. "Now please hear my pitch, oh mighty hero of the Republic."`
			label offer
			`	He makes a show of breathing in and out dramatically. "I've always had a dream, a deep rooted wish that I never thought I could fulfil." A long dramatic pause follows before be suddenly shouts. "To become filthy stinking rich!" He lets a wide cocky grin cover his face.`
			`	"Now it's not noble, but really who gives a shit about nobility in this day and age. All that matters are hard earned credits, ideally with as little of the 'hard' part as possible. I have a business venture that can only work in the present, while this little world is still an anomaly, exempt from the usual politics and bullshit of the wider galaxy, while also being in one of the most secure and protected spots you can find this side of the Paradise worlds."`
			`	A printed out collection of spreadsheets are pulled into view of the camera, each listing a wide range of details, from average pirate activity, to potential tax on revenue from each government, all the way to stability of coffee imports. "I've ran every number I could think of, and it all points to one thing, this is a deal you do not want to miss out on."`

"WAIT, wait, just come to Pugmug or whatever this shithole is called, I'll send the coordinates and, and even pay you when you get here for the troubles, 50k credits please just hear me out!" His tone has a streak of desperation in it.`

Fuck it just know we'll be rich!"`

			`	He types on a loud and clunky keyboard just out of sight, before giving one last smile to the camera as the call cuts. Your computers receive a set of coordinates to a small Pug city, in a mostly untouched part of Pugglemug. Hopefully this is a legitimate offer and not an assassination, since no one else will be around for miles, the guy didn't even tell you his name.`

			`It takes some time to find a landing pad, allowing you you a good view of the city as you search. It sits on the shore of a great lake, giving you an almost idyllic view as the sun rises in the distance, the city seems to have an industrial look, though with Pug building who knows.`
			`	As you finally find a spot to land, you can see a man who matches your quarry leaning against a building waiting for you, it seems the mystery man is waiting for you to land.`
			`	He stands in a relaxed posture, a grin permanently etched onto his face. His hair is greasy but well styled, and as he grins you can see he has a single missing tooth that gives his face an asymmetrical look. His ethnicity is hard to tell, but from his accent in the call, he is probably from New Britain. The only standout part of his outfit is a sizable brown overcoat, which looks almost comically large for him.`
			`	You exit your ship and he marches over, suddenly reaching to grab your hand and shake it before you can react. "Good to meet ya face to face, realised in my excitement in meeting thee Captain <last> I didn't give my name, thousand apologies and all that. My good name is Derek Star, business entrepreneur and future billionaire."`
			`	He releases your hand and steps back. "Come with me, the warehouse is just over a few blocks over thata way. I would prefer it to be just us, but if you gotta bring any bodyguards I ain't got a problem with that, gotta be safe and all." He smirks and begins walking off into the city, expecting you to follow.`

			`	It takes half hour to reach what you assume to be a warehouse district, though the Pug architecture makes it hard to tell, the buildings here are massive and rise almost five stories tall. Derek pulls out some keys, each of which look like children’s toys, which slots one into a door, which clicks open.`
			`	Inside is a massive open room, easily able to hold an entire starship inside. He marches across and unlocks another door that opens to a stairwell that leads underground. "Just down here, originally I was just looking around this city for stuff to take off world. Fancy alien tech to sell and all that. These warehouses were all stripped bare when I found em though, nothing left. Well that or nothing was here to begin with."`
			`	He leads you down the stairs until he reaches another door which he also unlocks. "But luckily I was smart enough to brea-I mean find a way into these here basements, and I found the treasure trove." The door opens into a vast factory complex, though far more colorful than your usual factory. Machines of all types sit in rows upon rows across the expansive complex, each for a different unknown purpose.`
			`	"IT'S A STARSHIP FACTORY!" He shouts out, gesturing across the factory floor. "A whole manufacturing complex sitting right under a dozen random warehouses in the middle of nowhere. It even has a massive shielded blast door under the nearby lake, which somehow lets ships pass through without flooding the place, ain't it amazing!" He wears the first true smile you have seen from him as he speaks excitedly.`
			`	"I worked for a couple years in one of those Syndicate slave wage shipyards, and I can verify that everything in here is top of the line machinery, although you gotta fiddle with em to remove some stupid safety locks and such. This place would cost over a billion credits to setup anywhere else, and I got it all for only two million."`

					goto agreed
				`	"And why am I here?"`

				goto offer
			label yep
			`	"Yep, my reaction too. Thought I had stumbled upon some secret republic base and I was gonna be shot. Haha, I ran outta here so fast, but then a couple days later, came back and, whadya know, still empty. I thought ‘damn I'm lucky’."`
				goto offer
			label agreed
			`	"I know right. This isn't something you just stumble upon and forget, took me a week before I properly explored this place. Found fuck all, everything is in pristine condition, all of it works perfectly, and best of all, not a soul other than me knew it was here."`
				goto offer
			label quick
			`	"A question I'm sure you are desperate to know the answer to, now that you have seen what I can offer." A cocky lopsided grin covers his face. "No worries, that answer will be given soon enough my friend. Gotta let me show off a little first you know?"`
			label offer
			`	A wave of his hand signals him beginning to move. "Let's not talk business looking over a ledge, I got a nice little corner set aside for our chat, come on." Gesturing to a stairwell, he leads you down to a curtained off corner of the factory. Inside you find a computer desk covered in files and documents that seems to be where he was during your call, though the chaos from before is limited to the desk this time. Instead sitting next to the desk is a fine wooden table with two chairs, an ornate fruit bowl sits in the centre filled to overflowing, along with packs of various snacks.`
			`	Derek sits at the table and picks up to begin peeling a banana. "Sit down, no point standing around." You take your seat while be begins enjoying his fruit.`

				`	(Take one of the snacks.)`

			`	"So I'll be straight with you, I want your face." He waits a moment before continuing. "Not literally, but for you to be the face of what will be my company. I can bring in skilled workers from the Syndicate who would love some good wages for good work. I can negotiate with the corporations for the right to produce and sell their goods for a cut. But I can't bring in customers, even with these good looks." He winks with a smirk.`
			`	"Your name is known across the whole of human space, both scumbag pirates and honourable Navy goons know about you. I get advertisements with your name on them, a commercial or two, and that will be enough to bring in a steady stream of eager captains, each of which wanna be just like that badass captain from the news." He leans back while picking some food from his teeth.`
			`	"I get your face to market my goods, and to make the big boys in business take me seriously. You, well you get first pick off the production lines, and I am willing to offer a steady and increasing salary, based on how much you help build this little empire. Plus I will put in your contract that every big decision must be run by you, if we get an opportunity to bring in a new line of outfits, you get to say yay or nay." For the first time seems serious as he lists this out.`
			`	"I'm not looking to just piggy back offa your celebrity status, I want us to work together to make this place into the one stop shop for everything a captain needs to build whatever type of ship they need. I don't wanna be a Syndicate front, nor a Lionheart branch, I wanna have all of those sons of bitches grovelling at our feet to sell at this operation." He spits to the side, managing to miss the bin my a metre.`
			`	"So, you interested, or was all this work a waste of my time?" Derek seems to look at you harshly as he waits for your answer, none of the previous mocking attitude remains apart from a sharp stare that cuts into you.`

"So right now other than my shuttle and the rights to this place, I have nothing to my name. I'm broke, I lied about paying ya, really sorry about that.

"I'll send you a message when I've got it all sorted, with your signature the loan sharks should keep back until we can pay and all the authorities should fast track a business co-owned by the Republic Hero themselves, at least I hope they will, otherwise this will take bloody months." He claps your back good naturedly and grins. "Don't die in space in the meantime."`

His craft passes through the field with no trouble, before rising slowly through the water and disappearing out of sight.`
			`	The walk back to your ship is quiet, but you are left wondering what is in store with this new venture. Thinking about it, he never told you the name of the company. As you enter your ship you see a new message from Derek. "Oh and the name of the company is Star Industries, this is non-negotiable, cause I promised my mum I would name it that, so no discussion that's the name."`

			`Your ship pierces the atmosphere, and thrusters kick in to lower you onto a landing pad in one of the many vast industrial districts the litter <origin>. A gathering of rough looking people are gathered nearby, a pile of belongings organised beside them. Once Dereks shuttle descends a handful of the people split off and approach his craft, each the largest and toughest from among the gathering.`
			`	As your hatch opens for you to exit, you can see Derek climbing down from his shuttle, his usual clothes swapped out for a high class suit and tie. The man at the head of the approaching group is large at over 6ft with a build that makes him seem even larger, he has short blond hair and like all the other workers, is wearing simple dark blue overalls.`
			`	Derek open his arms as they approach. "Dedrich, how are you doing, you look great, you and your guys put in your notice like I told ya to?" The large man walks past Derek without a glance and comes to a stop before you, he looks you over for a moment.`

			`	He turns to look back at Derek and his voice loses its serious tone. "How the hell did you pull this off, getting a war hero to sponsor you, I believed you about the secret factory but this seemed like you were scamming us." The posture of the group seems to change as his voice becomes more jovial, almost like they were prepared for a fight until now.`
			`	"Just my charm and mystique, and the fact that they saw how brilliant my business idea was and saw how much we could make once it's all running." Derek speedily walks around the group and drapes an arm across your shoulders. "Me and <first> are partners in this, they are your boss as much as I will be"`
			`	Dedrich chuckles. "Good, at least now we have proper assurance about all this, before it was a gamble considering it was just your dumbass running things." The rest of the group laughs openly and you can see Dereks smile slip for a moment. "I trust the wages are finally decided, and I expect it will be appropriate for the risk I'm having my people take here."`

				`	"I gave Derek 7 million credits for the workers’ wages, your people will be looked after."`

			`	Derek holds his hands up. "I know I know, you told me as much when we were negotiating, no need to bring up the past in front of, polite company." He awkwardly laughs.`
			`	The massive man looks to you, then shrugs. "You are right, the past is dead, fully dead now. As long as my people are looked after, your factory will be run like butter, which I can promise." He turns and marches back to the gathering workers, organising them and getting them into your ship.`

			`	The man’s stare is inscrutable as he looks down at Derek, but soon enough he nods and goes to turn. "That will be enough. As long as my people are looked after, your factory will be run like butter, which I can promise." He marches back to the gathering workers, beginning to organise them for the journey to <destination>.`

This meant you were forced to continually remind them who is actually flying the ship.`
			`	Dedrich comes into the cock pit as you come to the lake. He watches as the water swallows your ship and sink down until passing through the energy field. "God damn, I knew we fought actual aliens but seeing this is something else. I'll get my guys ready to work immediatly, it looks like this place will need some setup before it's churning out outfits."`
			`	The workers quickly unpack and begin powering on the vast factory complex, as you watch from the catwalk above. Derek soon enough appears out of nowhere and sits on the railing beside you. "I got us workers, and part of their contract is to never talk about this place, Dedrich is making sure that's drilled into their heads. Don't want the authorities finding out about this place before were properly established and can make this stuff pass off as built by us."`
